# Y2K OS
Hey everyone, I'm Candy, also [@themeowmews]() on Codédex. Here, I proudly present to you my masterpiece, the Y2K OS. It's a webOS ispired by a hackclub tutorial.

## How to Use
Y2K OS will have a loading screen, and after that, it will start the whole thing.

### Easter Egg
If you switch your settings of time and wait until 2000, you'll be greeted by a power outage, but then... You'll get fireworks and music and endscreen :3
